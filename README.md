# Smart Parking Assistant

## Overview
Smart Parking Assistant is an IoT-based project that uses Arduino and multiple IR sensors to detect available parking spots and provide real-time recommendations to drivers. This system aims to optimize parking space utilization and reduce the time spent searching for parking spots.

## Features
- Real-time monitoring of up to 10 parking spots
- User-friendly GUI for easy visualization of parking spot availability
- Intelligent recommendation system for optimal parking spot selection
- Arduino-based sensor network for reliable detection
- Customizable and expandable for various parking lot sizes

## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino Uno
- 10 IR sensors
- Jumper wires
- 2 Themisto TH-B830 Breadboards (or equivalent)
- USB cable for Arduino connection

## Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries:
  - pyserial
  - tkinter
  - Pillow

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
- git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-parking-assistant.git
- cd smart-parking-assistant
2. Set up the Arduino:
- Open the Arduino IDE
- Load the `arduino_sketch.ino` file
- Upload the sketch to your Arduino Uno

3. Install required Python libraries:
- pip install pyserial pillow

4. Configure the serial port:
- In `parking_assistant.py`, update the `arduino_port` variable with your Arduino's COM port

## Usage

1. Ensure the Arduino is connected and the sketch is uploaded
2. Run the Python script:
3. The GUI will display the status of each parking spot and provide recommendations

## Project Structure
- `arduino_sketch.ino`: Arduino code for reading sensor data
- `parking_assistant.py`: Main Python script for GUI and logic
- `images/`: Directory containing icons and images for the GUI
- `README.md`: Project documentation
